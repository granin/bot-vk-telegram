# Project Agent Guidelines

## Project Overview
This repository contains a Python bot that interacts with both VK and Telegram. The bot relies on selenium and the vk_api and pyrogram packages. Main logic lives in `main.py` with helper code in `worker.py` and configuration in `config.py`.

## Development Environment
- Use Python 3.8+.
- Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- The bot expects directories `input`, `output` and `bin` to exist.
- Start the bot with `python main.py` once configured.

## Code Style and Standards
- Follow PEP8 for Python code.
- Keep lines under 100 characters when possible.
- Use snake_case for function and variable names.

## Testing Guidelines
- Lint the Python code with `flake8` before committing.
- There are currently no automated tests, but add `pytest` tests when contributing new features.

## PR and Commit Conventions
- Prefix commit messages with `[PENDING-L4]` while awaiting review or `[AI-L4]` when generated by an AI agent.
- Use the form `[TAG] scope: short summary` for the commit subject line.
- Create branches as `task/<id>-<description>`, `feature/<name>` or `fix/<name>` as appropriate.
- Open pull requests against `main` and ensure CI checks pass before requesting review.
